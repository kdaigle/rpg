# RPG

Let's play an RPG, shall we?

## Goals

* Be able to play a simple-ish but longterm turn based game with friends online
* Take your character from adventure to adventure with no permadeath
* Optimize for fun between real-life friends who can't play together in real life

### Technology

This code is written using Ruby 2.1.0 but is tested against 1.9.3, 2.0.0, and 2.1.0.
I make no promises about version support.
